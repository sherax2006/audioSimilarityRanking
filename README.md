 Audio Similarity Ranking

**Audio Similarity Ranking** is a Streamlit-based application that performs MFCC (Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients) feature extraction from audio files and ranks the similarity of a test audio sample against a set of uploaded training samples. It supports both uploading and live recording of test audio.

This project is ideal for **speaker recognition**, **voice matching**, and audio similarity research. Designed with a user-friendly interface and real-time feedback.

 üìå Features

- Upload a ZIP of training audio samples (supports `.ogg` format)
- Extract and store 13-dimensional MFCC features
- Upload or record a test audio sample
- Compare the test sample with training audio using cosine similarity
- Display ranked results and similarity scores
- Playback top 5 matching audio samples directly in the browser

Use Case Scenarios

-  **Speaker Identification**: Compare unknown voices to known samples
- **Voice Cloning Detection**: Identify similarity between real and synthetic voices
-  **Research Projects**: Explore MFCC and audio processing methods
-  **Interactive Demos**: Present audio ML applications via browser

 ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works

1. **Upload a ZIP** file of training audio files (only `.ogg` are processed).
2. The app extracts **MFCC features** from each file using `librosa`.
3. User provides a test audio file via upload or recording.
4. MFCC features are extracted from the test audio.
5. **Cosine similarity** is computed between test and training MFCC vectors.
6. Results are ranked and displayed with similarity scores.
7. Top 5 matches are played for auditory comparison.
